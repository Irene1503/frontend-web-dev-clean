        <h1>&rarr; WHAT WE ARE DOING</h1>

<p><span class="highlight">Jehovah’s Witnesses promote a balanced, healthy lifestyle.</span> Our Bible educational program has helped people to overcome addictions and destructive habits.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">We adhere to strict safety standards in our construction projects.</span> Volunteers who help build our meeting places and other facilities that are used to further our Bible educational work are trained to avoid injury. Our buildings are inspected on a regular basis so that they conform to local safety laws.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">We provide humanitarian assistance.</span> During a recent 12-month period, we responded to some 200 life-threatening disasters worldwide and spent nearly 12 million dollars of donated funds to provide relief for victims.</p>

<p>When Ebola outbreaks began to devastate the population of West Africa (2014) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018), we educated people on how to prevent the spread of the deadly disease. We sent representatives to speak to groups on the subject “Obedience Saves Lives.” We provided handwashing stations at the entrance of each of our places of worship and stressed the importance of handwashing and other practical safeguards.</p>

<p>In Sierra Leone, a radio announcement commended Jehovah’s Witnesses for helping Witnesses and non-Witnesses in the community to avoid the Ebola virus.</p>
